### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Hello I'm Kevin!
I'm a full stack software engineer with a background in behavior psychology. I love exploring new frameworks and learning about different approaches to software design. 

My goal as a developer is to be a little bit more knowledgeable and experienced than I was yesterday.
